Description :   Adds a helper submenu to the plugin menu to offer these
                functions:
                - Load single plugin or load all plugins in a folder
                - Go to weblinks for plugin collections
                - Go to weblinks for Ruby resources
                
Usage :         The web links are self-explanatory. All will open in an
                external (system standard) browser. For the plugin loading
                functions it is important to note that plugin files have a RB
                extension.
